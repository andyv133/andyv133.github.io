When I woke up, it was clear that I was the last one to roll out of bed. The
Belgians were packing up tents and loading up. Gerd, The
German, having sprung for a "fancy" bunk, didn't have to pack up his tent today,
although he did have to repack all of the things that he had unpacked inside his
bunk. The man from New Jersey had already skipped town, eye patch and all. After
making the rounds, I learned that the Belgians, Jonas and Pieter, were headed for Fairbanks today,
and tommorow were going to start on the Dalton Highway to Deadhorse. Gerd,
on the other hand, was headed for McCarthy, south of where was now, and way out of the way.
This left me with a choice - I could also head to Fairbanks and do more group
riding which I had no real love for, or I could just hang out for a day. I had
been pretty much in the constant company of people since before heading up the
Dempster Highway, and it didn't take me long to realize that once every one
left, I would have the _entire_ campground to myself. That sounded pretty nice -
a day in a quiet corner in Alaska with just the trees.

So, thats what I did. I spent the morning catching up on maintenance on the
bike - adjusting the chain, re-working the mount for the exhaust heat shield so
that it wouldn't be rattling around, as well as a general check of the tires.
One thing that made this a real treat was that this was a motorcycle campground,
the owner loves motorcycles, and she maintains a shed full of basic tools that
make DIY maintenance a breeze when you're on the road. She also seems to collect
a few various parts, so that can be helpful too.

After completing all the work I had been avoiding, I went for lunch at Fast
Eddies, which is a fairly famous restaurant right on the Alaska Highway. The
food was good, the prices were appropriate for Alaska, and it was comfy. A nice
place to stop for a weary traveller.

After lunch, I spent the afternoon with a nap, some reading, and a couple hours
of work catching up on notes and the blog. It was a perfect place for it - even
though we were less than a mile from the Tok Cutoff highway, the sound of
traffic was rare due to the dense forest. I didn't see a whole lot of wildlife,
but I think I was less out in the middle of the woods than it felt like. As
usual for July in Alaska, the weather was cool and dry, so sitting in the spots
of sun that made it through the forest felt good so long as I could see my
laptop screen. I was also a little at the mercy of my laptop battery - I hadn't
found the one power outlet available in camp.

Eventually I got hungry, so I hopped on my freshly adjusted bike and scooted into
town. Tok doesn't have an overwhelming number of eating establishments, and I don't
really ever get tired of Thai, so I lined up again at Jen's Thai.
This time I went for a pad thai, which was a minor mistake. The food was
delicious, but the portions were huge, and my bike doesn't have a fridge (yet),
so leftovers were not an option. I was the only one there at the time, although
there were several people that had called orders in and picked them up. Rainy
weather had blown in so I got to sit and listen to the rain on the canopy as I
enjoyed my meal. No complaints here.

Stuffed with Thai, I rolled back to camp and sought shelter from the rain. When
you're tent camping, there's usually only one option, the tent, which gets
pretty old. But, the Eagle Claw campground has a proper group campsite complete
with a shelter. Its just a wooden structure with a metal roof, but it does have
a little fire ring under it, and there was no shortage of firewood. I made a
nice little fire and took up a cozy spot with my Kindle and enjoyed the warmth.
I was eventually joined by Vanessa, the campsite owner, who came out to
collect my rent. We chatted for a while about everything, as she does with all
who travel through her campsite. She was originally from Pennsylvania and had
moved to Alaska with her husband, then settled in Tok. They opened up the Eagle
Claw campground and ran it together. Eventually they decided to go their
separate ways, and so she bought his half of the operation and now owns it
herself, but her ex-husband occsionally stops by to help out. The campground is
really just a side job, her real job is working at Forty Mile Air, the
local airport. She really enjoys meeting people and motorcyclists, and Tok is in
such a perfect spot, and so the campground is a perfect seasonal job. Word has
gotten out in the motorcycle community and many of us make a point to stop
there whenever we can. Every year there is an event in Dawson, where I had just
been the other day, called Dust to Dawson. As motorcyclists travel to and fro
from that event, Eagle Claw does good business. They cram their tents in every
available corner, fill up all of the bunks, and generally have a good time.

We also talked about the sauna that had just been completed. She
offered to get it going for me, but I had to explain to her that I'm from
Houston - heat and humidity isn't something that I would seek out intentionally.
I don't think the point really got across, she'll just have to visit sometime. The sauna
she has is actually the second iteration. Last year a couple of wet and weary
motorcyclists from the lower 48 had come into camp and needed to dry their
clothes. The only place to do that is the sauna, so she got it up and running
for them, and left instructions on how to throttle the fire by adjusting the wood
burning stove. Well, they missed that part, the fire got too hot, and the sauna
itself caught fire. By the time the fire department got it out, there wasn't
anything left. There was no insurance and everyone felt bad about it. It was
the end of the trip for the visitors, and the end of the sauna. They left their
motorcycles in Tok and flew home since most of their gear was lost in the fire,
but planned to return the following summer to help rebuild the sauna. Well,
things happen and they haven't made it back yet, but being resourceful Alaskans,
Vanessa and friends rebuilt the sauna with a new stove, and hopefully better
operating instructions.

Nobody else had shown up to the campsite that night, and so after Vanessa left
the fire, I had the place to myself once again. I kept a very close eye on the
fire, enjoyed the rain, then headed off to bed when it seemed like it was late
enough.
