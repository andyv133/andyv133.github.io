I'm sitting on an airplane, knees jammed up against the seat in front of me and hoping that the guy in front of me doesn't recline his seat.  Such is the glory of airplane travel.  Only hours ago I was in New Orleans, just having wrapped up four days of the 2018 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.  Just like every year, it did not disapppoint.  The fest was well executed, the food was fantastic, the music was wonderful, and I came away with a few new bands to explore.
