<h4>The Basics</h4>
<p>I am an electrical engineer who is interested in the world of embedded systems and though I dislike the acronym, IoT.  Building systems that inform us about our world and enable us to be smarter about how we live is my goal.  After a string of office jobs that I found a strong distaste for, I have moved in my own direction of becoming a freelance engineer.  If you like what you see on this site and you've got an idea, feel free to contact me, even you think its a little crazy.  Crazy ideas that just might work are what we need these days.</p>

<h4>Potpourri</h4>

<p>I love being outside.  If the weather is nice and I remembered to charge my laptop, thats where you'll find me working.   When I'm not working, I like to find my way to a remote campsite and sleep under the stars, or climb a mountain. Other things that interest me are open source software and all of the things it can do, motorcycles, mountain bikes, robotics, music and much much more!</p>
