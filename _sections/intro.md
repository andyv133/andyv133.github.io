Having lost the thrill of sending all of my juicy thoughts to social media companies, I decided it was time to stake out my own little corner of the internet, just like the good old days.

Here you'll find both tall and short tales, project logs, and other things; typically revolving around me and the things I do.  My goal is, aside from ~~taking over~~saving the world, to spread a little knowledge, start some discussion, get some feedback, and see where it takes me.  Doing things is fun, but discussing them with other people can be almost as rewarding.

Feel free to use the contact form, it's not just there because its pretty.  Let me know what you really think.
