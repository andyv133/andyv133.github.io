In a world where social media seems to be taking over the internet, I decided to stake out a little corner of my own, just like the good old days except in glorious HTML5.

Here you'll find both tall and short tales, project logs, and other things; typically revolving around me and the things I do.  Hope you enjoy it!  

Feel free to use the contact form, it's not just there because its pretty.
