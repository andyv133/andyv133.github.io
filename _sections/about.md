I am an engineer and I'm rethinking my direction in life.  Turns out, I love engineering and solving problems.  But I also don't want to spend 30-40% of my working life in a cubicle.  So, I'm trying to make my own way.

I was born in 1983, went to school in Texas, picked up a college degree or two, and struggle a bit with the mixed bag that is ADD.  I currently am self-employed and am working toward starting a small service company doing electrical design and programming for small businesses.
