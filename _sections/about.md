I am an engineer who is finding out just what he wants out of life and is trying to figure out how to get it.  So far it has been a bumpy ride, but sooner or later I think I'll get there - wherever there is.  Or I won't.  Its all about the journey anyway, right?

I was born in 1983, that uncanny valley between the Millenials and Gen X, went to school in Texas, picked up a college degree or two, and struggle a bit with the mixed blessing that is ADD.  I currently am self-employed and am working toward starting a small service company doing electrical design and programming for small businesses...

...right after I take a little trip to Alaska.
